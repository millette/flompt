## Beyond the basic prompt

Prompt engineering isn't magic — it's a discipline. Just like programming, there are patterns that work and anti-patterns to avoid.

Here are 5 techniques you can apply immediately.

## 1. Role prompting

Giving the AI a role radically changes its behavior. This isn't a gimmick — it activates specific response patterns in the model.

```
You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience
in distributed systems. You favor simplicity and you explain
your technical choices.
```

**Why it works**: The role constrains the space of possible responses and guides the style, vocabulary, and level of detail.

## 2. Few-shot learning (guided examples)

Showing the AI what you expect is more effective than describing it. Few-shot learning consists of providing 2-3 examples of the desired format.

```
Transform these titles into URL slugs:

"My First Article" → my-first-article
"AI in 2026" → ai-in-2026

Now transform: "Why Prompt Engineering Matters"
```

**Why it works**: Examples implicitly define the rules without ambiguity.

## 3. Chain-of-thought reasoning

Asking the AI to reason before answering significantly improves quality, especially for complex tasks.

```
Before answering, break down your reasoning into steps.
For each step, explain why you make that choice.
Then give your final answer.
```

**Why it works**: Forcing explicit reasoning reduces shortcuts and logical errors.

## 4. Negative constraints

Saying what you **don't** want is as important as saying what you do want. Negative constraints eliminate undesirable patterns.

```
Write a technical explanation.
- Do NOT use metaphors
- Do NOT start with "In today's world..."
- No bullet points, paragraphs only
- Maximum 200 words
```

**Why it works**: LLMs have default patterns (bullet lists, generic intros). Negative constraints break them.

## 5. Feedback iteration

The best prompt is rarely the first one. Structured iteration means:

1. Send an initial prompt
2. Analyze what's missing or excessive in the response
3. Add constraints or clarifications
4. Repeat

```
That's better, but:
- The tone is too formal, make it more conversational
- Shorten paragraph 2
- Add a concrete example at the end
```

**Why it works**: Each iteration refines the result. It's prompt debugging.

## Combining techniques

These 5 techniques aren't mutually exclusive. An effective prompt often combines:
- A clear **role**
- Format **examples**
- **Chain-of-thought** for complex tasks
- Positive and negative **constraints**

This is exactly the combination that visual prompt building makes intuitive — each technique becomes a block you can activate, modify, or remove.

## Next step

Take your last prompt that didn't deliver the expected result. Apply these 5 techniques one by one. You'll see the difference from the first iteration.
